            Berlin is seeking to replace its aging fleet of seven Lockheed P-3 Orion sea patrol aircraft by 2025, and is eager to get the Poseidons, 
            which Boeing has developed as a replacement. They are currently in service with the US Navy, the RAF and the Royal Australian Air Force.
            In a formal notice to Congress, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency said the sale would “support the foreign policy and national security 
            of the United States by improving the security of a NATO” ally, which is described as “an important force for political and economic stability in Europe.”
            The program will require four US government officials and four contractors to spend two years in Germany to help with “equipment familiarization, training and 
            supply support,” the DSCA said. Congress will have to give the final approval to the sale, but it is unlikely to meet with opposition.
            The sale comes as a boon for Boeing, the main US maker of commercial aircraft, which over the past two years had to ground its 737 Max fleet over a series 
            of fatal crashes and then halt production at its largest facility in Washington due to the coronavirus pandemic.
